// True Dual Port RAM, made for on-chip Block RAMs (BRAMs) and LUT-RAM.
// Two read/write ports, separately addressed, with a common clock.
// Common data width on both ports.

// The READ_NEW_DATA parameter control the behaviour of simultaneous reads
// and writes to the same address. This is the most important parameter when
// considering what kind of memory block the CAD tool will infer.

// READ_NEW_DATA = 0 
// describes a memory which returns the OLD value (in the memory) on
// coincident read and write (no write-forwarding).
// This is well-suited for LUT-based memory, such as MLABs.

// READ_NEW_DATA = 1 (or any non-zero value)
// describes a memory which returns NEW data (from the write) on coincident
// read and write, usually by inferring some surrounding write-forwarding logic.
// Good for dedicated Block RAMs, such as M10K.

// The inferred write-forwarding logic also allows the RAM to operate at
// higher frequency, since a read corrupted by a simultaneous write to the
// same address will be discarded and replaced by the write value at the
// output mux of the forwarding logic.

// If you do not want write-forwarding, but keep the high speed, at the price
// of indeterminate behaviour on coincident read/writes, use "no_rw_check" as
// part of the RAMSTYLE (e.g.: "M10K, no_rw_check").
// Depending on the FPGA hardware, this may also help when returning OLD data.

// NOTE: set_global_assignment -name ADD_PASS_THROUGH_LOGIC_TO_INFERRED_RAMS
// OFF to disable creation of write-forwarding logic, as Quartus ignores the
// "no_rw_check" RAMSTYLE for M10K BRAMs.

// Also, we don't want a synchronous clear on the output: 
// any register driving it cannot be retimed, and it may not be as portable.

    // The only difference is the use of blocking/non-blocking assignments.

    // strictly correct, as they could cause simulation race conditions
    // depending on the order of evaluation of the always blocks. However,

    // letting the CAD tool decide if it can synthesize it, and how. It might
    // add forwarding logic, or could simply declare the read data "don't
